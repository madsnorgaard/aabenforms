```xml
<!-- Add custom Ballerup decision gateway -->
<bpmn:exclusiveGateway id="Gateway_ParkingZone" name="Parking Zone?">
  <bpmn:incoming>Flow_AfterValidation</bpmn:incoming>
  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_ZoneA</bpmn:outgoing>
  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_OtherZones</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:exclusiveGateway>

  <bpmn:conditionExpression xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression">
    ${zone == 'A'}
  </bpmn:conditionExpression>
</bpmn:sequenceFlow>
```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test workflow execution

# Verify decision logic
drush aabenforms:validate-workflow parking_permit
```

---

## Municipality Onboarding Process

### User Account Setup

**Case Workers** (20-30 accounts):

```bash
# Bulk import from CSV
# CSV format: name,email,department,role
drush aabenforms:import-users ballerup-users.csv

# Example CSV:
# "Jens Hansen","jens.hansen@ballerup.dk","Teknik og Miljø","case_worker"
# "Marie Nielsen","marie.nielsen@ballerup.dk","Børn og Skole","case_worker"
```

**Administrators** (2-3 accounts):

- Full access to all workflows
- Can configure workflows
- Can manage users

**Citizens** (test group - 20-30 volunteers):

- MitID login (production credentials)
- Self-service portal access
- Volunteer agreement signed

### Department-Specific Configuration

**Teknik og Miljø (Building and Environment)**:
- Workflows: Building Permit, Parking Permit
- Integration: GIS system (for zoning validation)
- Custom fields: Cadastral number, plot size

**Børn og Skole (Children and Schools)**:
- Workflows: Daycare Enrollment
- Integration: Daycare capacity system
- Custom fields: Sibling priority, special needs

**Borgerservice (Citizen Service)**:
- Workflows: All (read-only for support)
- Access level: View-only

### Branding and Localization

**Visual Branding**:
```bash
# Upload municipality logo
drush media:create --name="Ballerup Logo" \
  --bundle=image \
  --file=/path/to/ballerup-logo.png

# Configure theme colors
drush config:set aabenforms_tenant.settings.ballerup \
  primary_color "#005ca9" \
  secondary_color "#ffcc00"
```

**Email Templates**:
- Customize email footer with Ballerup contact info
- Add municipality logo to email header
- Translate system messages to Danish (if not already)

**Citizen Portal**:
- Custom homepage message
- Municipality-specific FAQ
- Links to Ballerup's main website

---

## Data Migration

### Assessment Phase

**Identify Data Sources**:

- [ ] **Existing systems**:
  - Legacy form system (e.g., Adobe FormServer)
  - Case management system (e.g., SBSYS)
  - Spreadsheets (parking permits, daycare lists)

- [ ] **Data types**:
  - Historical submissions (last 2 years)
  - Active cases (in-progress applications)
  - User accounts (case workers)
  - Configuration (workflow rules, approval matrices)

### Migration Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: **Phased Migration**

**Phase 1**: Configuration Only (Week 1-2)
- Migrate workflow configurations
- Migrate user accounts
- NO historical data (fresh start)

**Phase 2**: Active Cases (Week 3-4, optional)
- Migrate in-progress applications
- Manually recreate active cases in ÅbenForms
- Small dataset (10-20 cases)

**Phase 3**: Historical Data (Post-Pilot, optional)
- Archive historical data
- Provide read-only access via reporting module
- No need to recreate old workflows

### Migration Scripts

**User Account Migration**:

```php
<?php
// scripts/migrate-users.php

use Drupal\user\Entity\User;

$csv = fopen('ballerup-users.csv', 'r');
fgetcsv($csv); // Skip header

while (($row = fgetcsv($csv)) !== FALSE) {
  [$name, $email, $department, $role] = $row;

  $user = User::create([
    'name' => $email,
    'mail' => $email,
    'status' => 1,
    'field_full_name' => $name,
    'field_department' => $department,
  ]);

  $user->addRole($role);
  $user->save();

  echo "Created user: $name ($email)\n";
}

fclose($csv);
```

**Run migration**:
```bash
drush php:script scripts/migrate-users.php
```

**Workflow Configuration Migration**:

If the municipality has existing workflow rules in another system:

```bash
# Export existing workflows to JSON
# (Manual process - review with municipality)

# Import custom workflows
drush aabenforms:import-workflow-config ballerup-parking-permit.json

# Validate imported workflow
drush aabenforms:validate-workflow parking_permit --municipality=ballerup
```

### Data Migration Checklist

- [ ] Data inventory completed
- [ ] Migration scope agreed with municipality
- [ ] Migration scripts developed and tested
- [ ] Backup of source data created
- [ ] Test migration on staging environment
- [ ] Municipality approval on migrated data
- [ ] Production migration scheduled
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

## Parallel Testing Strategy

### Why Parallel Testing?

Parallel testing (running old and new systems side-by-side) provides:

1. **Safety net**: Municipality can revert to old system if needed
2. **Data validation**: Compare outputs from both systems
3. **User confidence**: Gradual transition reduces anxiety
4. **Risk mitigation**: Catches discrepancies before full cutover

### Parallel Testing Phases

**Phase 1: Shadow Mode** (Weeks 5-6)

- **Old system**: Primary (100% of real cases)
- **New system**: Secondary (duplicating cases for testing)
- **Case workers**: Process each case in BOTH systems
- **Citizens**: Use old system only

**Workflow**:
```
Citizen submits application (old system)
  ↓
Case worker manually recreates in ÅbenForms
  ↓
Case worker processes in BOTH systems
  ↓
Compare results (should be identical)
  ↓
Approve in old system (official decision)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% of cases successfully recreated in ÅbenForms
- Decision outcomes match in both systems
- Case workers comfortable with ÅbenForms interface

**Phase 2: Pilot Mode** (Weeks 7-8)

- **Old system**: Primary (80% of cases)
- **New system**: Primary for pilot cases (20% of cases)
- **Case workers**: Process pilot cases ONLY in ÅbenForms
- **Citizens**: Pilot volunteers use ÅbenForms, others use old system

**Workflow**:
```
Citizen volunteers submit to ÅbenForms
  ↓
Case worker processes ONLY in ÅbenForms
  ↓
Decision is OFFICIAL (no old system involved)
  ↓
Monitor for issues, collect feedback
```

**Success Criteria**:
- 20% of cases processed successfully in ÅbenForms
- No major incidents or data loss
- Positive feedback from citizens and case workers

**Phase 3: Majority Mode** (Weeks 9-10)

- **Old system**: Fallback (20% of cases)
- **New system**: Primary (80% of cases)
- **Case workers**: Default to ÅbenForms, use old system only for complex/legacy cases
- **Citizens**: Most use ÅbenForms, old system still available

**Workflow**:
```
Citizens use ÅbenForms by default
  ↓
Case workers process in ÅbenForms
  ↓
Complex edge cases: escalate to old system
  ↓
Monitor edge cases, refine workflows
```

**Success Criteria**:
- 80% of cases processed in ÅbenForms
- Edge cases documented and addressed
- Old system usage declining

### Parallel Testing Procedures

**Case Worker Checklist (Shadow Mode)**:

For each application:

- [ ] Receive application in old system
- [ ] Manually recreate in ÅbenForms
- [ ] Process in ÅbenForms
- [ ] Process in old system
- [ ] Compare outcomes:
  - [ ] Approval/rejection decision matches
  - [ ] Notification content matches
  - [ ] Processing time comparable
- [ ] Document any discrepancies
- [ ] Submit decision via old system (official)

**Daily Reconciliation**:

```bash
# Export applications from old system
# Export applications from ÅbenForms

# Compare counts
old_system_count=25
aabenforms_count=25

if [ $old_system_count -eq $aabenforms_count ]; then
  echo " Counts match"
else
  echo "✗ Discrepancy: $old_system_count vs $aabenforms_count"
fi

# Compare outcomes (manual review)
diff old_system_decisions.csv aabenforms_decisions.csv
```

### Handling Discrepancies

**If outcomes differ**:

1. **Document the case**
   - Case ID in both systems
   - Application details
   - Decision in old system
   - Decision in ÅbenForms
   - Reason for difference

2. **Analyze root cause**
   - Data entry error?
   - Workflow logic error?
   - Integration issue?
   - Business rule interpretation?

3. **Escalate to ÅbenForms team**
   - Report via Slack/Teams
   - ÅbenForms team investigates within 24 hours
   - Fix deployed if needed

4. **Re-test case**
   - Recreate scenario in staging
   - Verify fix
   - Document in lessons learned
