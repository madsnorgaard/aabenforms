## ÅbenForms Digital Workflow Platform for Danish Municipalities

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: February 2026
**Target Audience**: Municipal decision-makers, IT managers, digital transformation leaders
**Status**: Pre-pilot POC. Live demo at https://aabenforms.dk (frontend) and https://api.aabenforms.dk (backend). MitID via Keycloak mock; Serviceplatformen and Digital Post via test/mock endpoints. No production municipality deployments yet.

---

## Executive Summary

ÅbenForms is an open-source digital workflow automation platform aimed at Danish municipalities. It enables citizen-facing services through visual workflow design, integration with Danish government systems, and GDPR-minded data handling - with no licence fees. It is currently a pre-pilot POC: the workflow engine, MitID sign-in, and CPR/CVR lookups run against test/mock endpoints, and several integration actions (payment, SMS, GIS, payroll, calendar) are demo mocks today.

**Key Value Proposition**:
- Open source: no per-form or per-integration licence fees, unlike proprietary alternatives
- Visual workflow builder: the Workflow Modeler editor, no-code/low-code workflow creation
- Danish-first: integrations with MitID, CPR, CVR, DAWA, Digital Post (against test/mock endpoints today)
- GDPR-minded: field-level CPR encryption (AES-256) and audit logging built in
- Ready-made templates for common municipal services
- Modern architecture: API-first, headless, JSON:API, no vendor lock-in

---

## Platform Benefits

### 1. Cost Model

Proprietary self-service workflow platforms typically charge annual licence fees, often with
additional per-integration and per-form fees. ÅbenForms is open source and carries no licence
fees. Your costs are limited to hosting and whatever implementation or support you choose to
buy or do in-house.

**Where proprietary alternatives cost money** (generalised):
- Annual platform licence
- Per-integration module fees (MitID, CPR/CVR, Digital Post, etc.)
- Per-form or per-transaction fees in some models

**Where ÅbenForms costs money**:
- Hosting
- Optional implementation and support (in-house or bought)

There are no fabricated savings figures here; do your own comparison against your current
vendor's actual quote.

### 2. Rapid Deployment

- 13 ready-made workflow templates (BPMN source files) for common municipal workflows
- Visual workflow editing via the Workflow Modeler
- No custom development required for standard use cases

## Flagship Workflows

Note on integration status: in the current POC, MitID sign-in, CPR/CVR lookup, DAWA validation,
and audit logging are real (against test/mock endpoints). Payment, SMS, GIS, and calendar/booking
steps are demo mocks today. The "annual impact" estimates below are illustrative planning figures,
not measured results from any deployment - there are no production deployments yet.

### Workflow 1: Parking Permit Application

**Use Case**: Citizen applies for residential parking permit, pays fee, receives digital permit.

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Citizen submits application with vehicle registration, address, duration
2. Optional: MitID authentication for identity verification
3. Address validation via DAWA
4. Automatic fee calculation based on zone and duration
5. Payment processing via Nets Easy
6. PDF permit generation with QR code
7. Email delivery with PDF attachment
8. SMS confirmation with permit number
9. Audit log entry

**Business Value**:
- Reduces manual processing time from 3 days to instant
- Eliminates paper permits and postage costs
- 24/7 self-service availability
- Real-time payment reconciliation
- Digital audit trail for compliance

**Integration Points**:
- MitID (optional authentication)
- DAWA (address validation)
- Nets Easy (payment)
- SMS gateway
- PDF generation
- Email delivery

**Setup Time**: 1 week
**Technical Complexity**: Low

**Illustrative Annual Impact (Medium Municipality, planning estimate only - not measured)**:
- Applications processed: ~2,000
- Potential time saved if manual processing is fully automated
- Actual savings depend on the municipality's current process and volumes

### Workflow 2: Marriage Ceremony Booking

**Use Case**: Couple books marriage ceremony date with dual MitID authentication, payment, and automated reminders.

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Both partners authenticate with MitID
2. CPR lookup for both partners (SF1520)
3. Fetch available ceremony slots from municipal calendar
4. Calendar picker displays available dates/times
5. Couple selects preferred date and ceremony preferences
6. Booking fee calculation (church vs. civil ceremony)
7. Payment processing
8. Ceremony slot reservation
9. Marriage certificate PDF generation
10. Confirmation emails to both partners
11. SMS confirmations to both partners
12. Automated reminder 7 days before ceremony
13. Automated reminder 1 day before ceremony
14. Audit log entries

**Business Value**:
- Eliminates phone/email booking coordination
- Dual authentication ensures identity verification
- Automated reminders to reduce no-shows
- Calendar synchronization (calendar action is a demo mock today)
- Digital certificate delivery
- Complete audit trail for legal compliance

**Integration Points**:
- MitID (dual authentication)
- SF1520 CPR lookup (dual)
- Calendar/appointment system
- Payment processing
- PDF generation
- Email delivery (dual)
- SMS notifications (dual)
- Automated reminder scheduling

**Setup Time**: 2 weeks
**Technical Complexity**: Medium

**Illustrative Annual Impact (Medium Municipality, planning estimate only - not measured)**:
- Ceremonies booked: ~300
- Potential reduction in phone/email coordination time and no-shows
- Actual results depend on the municipality's current process

### Workflow 3: Building Permit Application

**Use Case**: Property owner applies for building permit with document upload, caseworker review, and approval workflow.

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Applicant authenticates with MitID
2. Identity verification via SF1520 CPR lookup
3. Property address validation via DAWA
4. Document upload (plans, drawings, specifications)
5. Automated document validation (file types, sizes)
6. Document completeness check
7. Caseworker task assignment
8. Caseworker reviews application in admin interface
9. Decision gateway:
   - **Approve**: Create case in SBSYS, send approval notice (SF1601), audit log
   - **Reject**: Send rejection email with reasoning, audit log
   - **Request More Info**: Email applicant, wait for response (30-day timeout)
10. If additional info received: Return to caseworker review
11. If timeout (30 days): Auto-reject with notification
12. Final audit log and case closure

**Business Value**:
- Eliminates paper submissions and postal delays
- Automated document validation reduces caseworker time by 30%
- Digital case management integration (SBSYS)
- Transparent status tracking for applicants

**Technical Complexity**: High

**Illustrative Annual Impact (Medium Municipality, planning estimate only - not measured)**:
- Applications processed: ~800
- Potential reduction in caseworker time and paper/postage
- Potential faster processing through automated pre-checks
- Actual results depend on the municipality's current process

## ROI - How to Build Your Own Estimate

There are no measured ROI figures to quote: ÅbenForms has no production deployments yet. Rather
than present fabricated numbers, build an estimate from your own data.

### Inputs to gather

- Annual volume per workflow (parking permits, marriage bookings, building permits, etc.)
- Current staff time per application and your loaded hourly staff cost
- Current paper/postage and reconciliation costs
- Your current vendor's actual licence and per-integration quote (for the comparison)

### Method

1. Estimate staff time potentially saved per workflow once routine steps are automated.
2. Multiply by volume and hourly cost for a conservative staff-time figure.
3. Add paper/postage and reconciliation savings where applicable.
4. Subtract your ÅbenForms costs: hosting plus any implementation/support you buy or staff
   in-house. Remember there are no licence fees.
5. Compare against the avoided proprietary licence and per-integration fees from your vendor quote.

Use conservative assumptions. The honest message is "no licence fees, open source, no lock-in,
modern JSON:API" - not a fabricated payback period.

## Deployment Status

ÅbenForms is a pre-pilot POC. There are no production municipality deployments and therefore
no customer references, satisfaction figures, or measured ROI to cite. Any "before/after"
numbers you may see elsewhere are illustrative planning estimates, not results from a real
municipality. We can run a live demo against test/mock endpoints and discuss a pilot.
